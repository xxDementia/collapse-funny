# COLLAPSE :: FUNNY (the mod)

this is a **FULL DIALOGUE REWRITE** of the collapse segment!! features:
* multi-timeline dialogue interactions with all characters
* only just a minor addition to combat
* asset swap in some places
* yeah nothin' much :ᶅ

*this mod has been in the works since october 10th!!! and i originally intended it to be a "collapse but all the dialogue is shorter" mod but it quickly spiraled out of control. aurora i blame you for this*
