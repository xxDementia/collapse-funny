**DRAFT OF #FRAMING-DEVICES MOD POST**

# COLLAPSE :: FUNNY (the mod)

this is a FULL DIALOGUE REWRITE of the collapse segment!! features:
* multi-timeline dialogue interactions with all characters, you must find it though :)
* only just a minor addition to combat
* asset swap in some places
* yeah nothin' much

### MASSIVE THANKS TO @AURORA FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE!!!!!
playtester and helped with debugging

this mod has been in the works since october 10th!!! and was originally intended to be a "collapse but all the dialogue is shorter" mod but it quickly spiraled out of control. aurora i blame you for this

ps @corru sorry in advance for butchering your dialogue

## paste into the **console** or make a **bookmarklet**
`javascript:(function(){addResources(["https://file.garden/ZBykMtEMpVTUWZ-e/collapsefunny.js"]), play("criticalError", 0.8)})();`

(<>) - ALERT::'not up to date';'filegarden';'not github'

**[RECOMMENDED]** there are some lines that only show once, so if you have already triggered those you wont see them. this will load it up to pre-collapse
(WARNING, OVERWRITES SAVE DATA)

`javascript:(function(){addResources(["https://file.garden/ZBykMtEMpVTUWZ-e/quickload.js"])})();`
